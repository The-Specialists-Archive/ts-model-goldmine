  God.. How anime has grown on TS. Well! Heres my entire collection of Anime related TS
player/weapon models with sounds. You'll find quite the selection and I hope you are
pleased with some of the fixes I've done to the models, but don't forget the real
credit goes to the origional modelers/skinners/animators. I'm only the guy who brought
it all together. ENJOY ANIME ON TS ON THE NEXT LEVEL!
