Description: 	The Black Mesa Research complex is best know for its High Energy Physics research, its Space program and its
                advanced weapons work. But its research is very diversified, it has got a small but nether the less highly 
                succesful robotics divsion. The division's foor legged cargo loaders (often they can seen from the tram and the way 
                to the material lab) are one of its notable succesess, but they are mere toys compare to its latest development, 
               				 The Automated Special Wepaons and Tactics Unit, ASWAT 
                A self contained close combat robot with multiple sensors, heavy armour, vast strengthand the
                most advanced goal seeking artifical inteligence system so yet developed. 

                    Dr Matthews was most proud of his creation, this was his masterpiece, his magnum opus, a machine that can
                do a humans job far better that any human could, even in the most extreme enviroments. ASWAT based police and military
                units could now go into action with no posibility of human casulaties, just as the cruise missile and smart 
                bomb had revolutionised the public's perception of Air Warefare, Automated Special Weapons and Tactics units
                would do the same for infantry and cops. With no politically dangerous friendly casualties, 
                ASWATs could go be sent anyware too risky (i.e area with high levels of media coverage) for humans. 

                   And do a better job too, thought Doctor Matthews, as he was calibrating the digit manpulators on his prototype
                in his lab in the prometheus section of the base on that fatefull day. 
                
		'Here is your coffee Doctor' said Yoshitsune the rather nervous lab assistant, edging is way into the lab past the mounds 
                 of tools, parts annd paperwork, desperatly trying not to spill the hot drink.
                'Yes Yes put it down, er' The doctors head span round looking for a spot in the chaotic lab. He failed.
                'Oh put it over there somewhere, can't you see I'm busy, get me a number two philips screwdriver, ready the firing range
                 and then boot up the high level descision module, we have some weapon tests to run. Did you remember 3 sugars for my coffee?' 
                'Yes doctor, sorry I mean no doctor, of course doctor' mumbled Yoshi, his head spining and still balancing the hot drink.
                 Yoshi, knowing we would never find the screwdriver in the messy lab in time for the doc, decided the bootup about the 
                 easiest task, after finding a spare couple of inches on doctors desk for the coffee, he hit the key on the pc with his elbow.
                 After a moment the blue robot in the corner started gently humming to itself,
                 its head started panning around the room, the  red unblinking cyclopean eye surveying the scene. 
                 Yoshi looked toward the doc, but he was ignoring him as he was now deeplly engrossed in examimining some small 
                 detail of the droid's underside, and taking small sips from his drink. 
                'He hasn't even noticed there is not sugar in it' thought a releaved Yoshi, 'Right Ok firing range next, That secrutiy guard
                 Barney has the keys, so .. go find him ' planned Yoshi 'Yeah get keys, he'll be doing his rounds about now, then oh yes ask him
                 if he has a screwdriver as well'
                'You guys seen a Dog?' said Barney sticking his head around the door of the lab, Yoshi looked glum, 'Damm his timing,
                 another excuse to get way from Matthews dashed'
                'No, No dogs here' replied the dejected assistant.
                'Guard, this is a robotics lab, what could of possibly got into your tiny little brain that we might have animal in here'
                 snapped Dr Mathews, rubbing his head. He had got up suddenly when the guard came in, and hit his head on the robots armour plated servo.
                'Take it easy Doc, Its just that I glimpsed this little guy from the corner of my eye on my round, some kind of fat little pug dog,
                 running down the coridor, I tried to follow him, but he bolted, and I'm sure I saw him duck in here.'
                'Definatly  no dogs here, try those clowns down in chemical weapons or genetic research, they use animals, i'm sure it ....' 
                 a russling in from under a pile of CAD drawings stopped Doctor Matthews mid sentance.
                 It emerged. 
                'Thats er, thats not a er ... dog,  dogs have like.... four legs'  Yoshi just about manageded to mumble.
                 Everyone else was silent, as the small faceless three legged creature shuffled out from under the papers.
                 Only momenterely shocked, he had seen stranger in these labs before, Matthews took charge
                'Well don't just stand there go 'GET it' he barked to the others.
                'Er ok' replied Barney, laying down his sub machine gun to free up his hands ' Im going to try and grab it, Yosh, with me.'
                 The creature was ingoring them it seemed to be 'sniffing', if indead it had a nose to snif with, they weren't sure
                 a power socket. Barney and Yoshi sliently inched forwards to within a good lunges distance from the dog like thing, 
                 gave each a worried glance, and then dived for it.
                 It may have had short legs but it still could move dam fast. To fast for the lab assistant and guard who carriered 
                 into some welding equipment, missing the creature by about a metre. 
                'Idiots' tutted the doctor. 
                 They got themselves up brushed them selves down and turned to see whee the dog has gone. It wasn't hidding. 
                 In just stood in one a the few clear spots on the floor.
                'It's making a humming nose,  getting louder' annouched Yoshi, a little of his fear being replaced by curisoity 
                'Shaking to, is it hurt or something ?' answered Barney
                 The harmonic blast from the houndeye answered the question, flinging people, parts and paper into the corners of the room.
                 The robot barely flinched though, well it took a lot more than that blast to move it's 203 kilogram bulk. But it did register the 
                 dammage. 0.02 seconds later the goal seeking alorigthm had come to the following conclusions
                 and paths of action to the resolve the problem.

        
                        Event : Self has taken dammge 
                             Goal : Self preservation
                             Path : Elimiate source of dammage

                        Event  : Multiple targets in local vicinity 
                        Search : No friendly target profiles loaded into database
                             Hence : All targets are possibly hostile
                         
                        Conclude : No data available on actual source of hostile action        
                             Hence : Assume all targets hostile

                        Action : Initialise Defensive mode 
                              Goal   : Defened self with force
                              Path   : Neutralise hostile targets           
                              Fact    : No internal weapons loaded
                                  Sub goal : Search for nearest weapon
                                  Action   : Located weapon in immedidate vicinity 
                                  Event    : Weapon HK MP5 sub machine gun acquired

                       Action : Targets locked 
                       Action : Safety off

                       BRRRRTTTTT   BRRTTT BRRTT   BRRRTTTTTT BRRRTTTT   BRRTTT BRRTT BBBBRRTT  BRRRTTTTTT
     
                       Event  : Local targets neutralised
                       Event  : Distant targets located
                       Fact   : All targets are hostile

                       New Goal Created 
                            Goal : Neutralise all targets
                            Path : Seek and destory

                       Action : Initialise Seek and Destory mode 


                       The AWSAT unit started its engine up and stomped out of the lab, its heavy feet crushing the scattered paper work,
                       brass shell casings and human and alien remains.
   

                 
Influences:	It's mainly influenced by Masamune Shirow's (My hero) landmate designs for his masterpiece of manga
                AppleSeed. Also in there though is a bit of Kenichi Sonada's Bubble Gum Crisis designs and
                Headgears PatLabour work. Plus the tail and exhaust pipes off a Ducati 916. Not sure how that got there.

Model Notes:	Model number Three. Very different from the last two, highly segmented. No joints bend
                visibly, so it looks robotic, jointed and solid. I've tried to avoid colisions and clipping
                of the segments but there still is a fair bit of it, although this isn't really noticable
                in play. The shoulders are a problem area, they can be raised as high as I would like without
                cutting into the body, the changed anims help conceal some of this.

                The skin mapping has the fewest errors so far, Yes Two 256x256 maps is a little greedy, 
                but the model has got a LOT of surface are to cover, the detail skin could be 128x128
                but then it would loose so much, so I left it big. The skins come to 132K, still under
                valves recomened 150k limit (and still half the size of the ones Unreal Tournement is going to use)

                The mesh is is totaly original, but was designed to fit the valve biped, it just doesn't
                look like it should. Unfortuantly to fit the biped it came out a bit shorter and narrower than I would of liked,
                pity. But to make it bigger would entail doing a new biped and reanimating, that is far to much 
                like hard work for a lazy sod like myself.
	        
		High polycount, but there a lot of detail there, and to be honest, most peoples machines
                nowadays can easily deal with models this big. It is still under the Q2PMP recommened 800 poly limit.

                Animation is still a week area for me, I try, but oh well. One problem with Half life is that you
                animate the biped not the model, and then the game engine goes and blends the different anims
                together and applies them to your mesh, so until you watch it in third person mode in game, 
                you are not sure how things are going to turn out. Still can you have animations in a Quake 2 model 
                for running, strafing and shooting an individual weapon simultaneously ?  Though not.

Tools used:  	Mesh			: Inspire 3D 1.0  (Actually model in Max? NEVER i say ;) )
		Mapping and bonning 	: 3D Studio Max R2.5 and Character Studio 2.0 
					  ( Cause I have to. Although, I must say that Character studio has got a few good
                                          points, and Proper UV mapping is very usefull, just wait till L[6] though ;) )
		Skins			: Corel Photopaint 8.0 ( because its better than photoshop ( I'm trying to be contraversial here ) )
		Compiling		: StudioMDL	
		Viewing			: Half-Life Model Viewer v1.1

Other:  	I sometimes can be found as "Gundam", late at night on Wireplay, Barry's world and other UK servers, 
                playing Half Life, TFC, or even Action Quake2.
		Nowadays I can be more often be found as "Katsumi" the Wood Elf Ranger on the EverQuest sever Erollisi Marr
		My corpses litter Crushbone Castle, so be carefull not to trip up on them ;)

Thanks:		Valve Software, For Half Life of course
		Wavelength modeling tutorials, absolutely essential, couldn't of done with out ya.
		Scarecrow for reviewing my last models Etac & MajorK on Cold Fusion.
                Cold Fusion, The Q2PMP and 3D The bodyshop for posting my last models and saying nice things about them.
                Everybody who emailed me about Etac and MajorK. many thanks for the words of encouragment.
		Every one who has done a Player model before, thanks for the inspiration and now I 
		really appreciate the work you put in to bring them to life.
                Norman Cook for his Fat boy slim CD "You've come a long way baby", this was played repeatedly
                during the creation of this model, track 10 "Love island" is ASWAT's personal theme tune.

No Thanks to:   Sony, Verant and 989 Studios. If it wasn't for Bloody Everquest being SO addictive this
                model would of been released two weeks ago.
