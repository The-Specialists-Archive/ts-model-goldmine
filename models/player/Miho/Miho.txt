Unfortunately they grew jealous of each other and decided to do what everyone else did. Shoot everyone in sight. After years of fighter only one of them survived. Elderly although strangely young looking woman named Miho. Due to her knoledge of the other and her experiance. She dominated the competition and now lives on to continue fighting in the bloody world of fighting Mercs, Hitmen, Military Grunts, Terrorists, Prefessional shooters. and everyone else in between in a bloody action packed spectical.Beware of the Cute ones.
