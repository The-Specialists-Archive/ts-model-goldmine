Domo-Kun - By Kit the Fox 6/5/2004

Includes: 1 player model.

Description:

  Domo-Kun's angry smashfest continues into the TS realm. Marvel at all the inherent inconsistancies that this model
  presents logistically.

  Back kick and jump kick.. I did those.

Installation: 

  Unzip to yer TS folder, wherever is is. Should work then, assuming that you have "use folder paths" checked.

Thanks for tryin':
